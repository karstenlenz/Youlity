# Youlity - Discover Your Personality

This has been my capstone project ("Digitales Gesellenst√ºck") for the web development bootcamp @ neue fische.

It's a progressive web app featuring an interactive questionnaire and a journal function. Highlights are a mobile-optimized UI with drag&drop and swipe gesture support. The app can be installed on used offline.
The app is responsive, however it is best viewed on a mobile device.
